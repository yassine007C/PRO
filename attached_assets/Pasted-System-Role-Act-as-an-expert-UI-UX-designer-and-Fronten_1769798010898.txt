System Role: Act as an expert UI/UX designer and Frontend Developer.Project Goal: Create a high-conversion landing page for a private online tutor specializing in Mathematics, Physics, and Programming.Target Audience: High school and university students, and career switchers looking to learn coding.Design Aesthetic:Style: Clean, modern, trustworthy, and academic but approachable.Color Palette: Dark mode or clean white with deep blue (trust) and green accents (growth).Typography: Monospace fonts for code sections; clean Sans-Serif (like Inter or Roboto) for the rest.Key Functionality:The site must not have a shopping cart.The primary Call to Action (CTA) is "Book via WhatsApp."All buttons should link to a WhatsApp API link.Required Sections (In Order):Hero Section: A strong headline, a subheadline explaining the value proposition, and a large "Start Learning" button that opens WhatsApp.About the Tutor: A photo placeholder, credentials (degree/experience), and a brief "Teaching Philosophy."Subjects Offered: A 3-column grid highlighting:Mathematics (Calculus, Algebra, etc.)Physics (Mechanics, Thermodynamics, etc.)Programming (Python, JavaScript, etc.)Pricing & Packages: A clear pricing table (Hourly rate vs. 10-lesson package).How it Works: A simple 3-step process icon set (Contact -> Schedule -> Zoom Link).Footer: Contact info, copyright, and social links.Technical Constraint:[If asking for code]: Write this in HTML5, Tailwind CSS, and a touch of JavaScript.[If asking for layout]: Describe the visual layout in detail.Specific Content:Tutor Name: [Your Name]Price: [e.g., $50/hour]WhatsApp Number for Link: [Your Number with country code, e.g., 15550000000]Phase 2: Detailed Section BreakdownIf you are building this section-by-section or want to refine the AI's output, here is the architectural logic you should follow.1. The Hero Section (The Hook)This is the first thing users see. It must immediately explain what you teach and how to buy.Headline: "Master Complexity. Learn Math, Physics, & Code."Sub-headline: "Personalized online tutoring tailored to your curriculum and pace."Visual Idea: A split screen. Text on the left; on the right, an abstract graphic combining a math formula and a code snippet.2. The Subject Cards (The Product)You need to visually distinguish the three topics. Ask the AI to create a "Grid Layout" for this.Mathematics: Use icons like $\sum$ or $\int$.Physics: Use icons like an atom or a trajectory curve.Programming: Use a terminal icon </>.3. The Pricing Strategy (The Offer)Since you are using WhatsApp, you want the user to know the price before they message you to filter out non-serious leads.Card 1 (Single Lesson): "Pay as you go."Card 2 (The Bundle): "10 Lesson Pack (10% off)." <-- Highlight this one.CTA Button: "Message to Book" (Links to WhatsApp).4. The WhatsApp Integration (The Engine)This is the most critical technical part. When asking the AI to write the code or set up the button, instruct it to use the WhatsApp Universal Link.The Logic:Instead of just sending them to the app, you want to pre-fill the message so the user doesn't have to type.The Format:https://wa.me/[Phone-Number]?text=[Encoded-Message]Example Prompt for the AI:"Make the main button link to https://wa.me/15551234567?text=Hi,%20I%20am%20interested%20in%20tutoring so it opens the app with the message pre-typed."Phase 3: Technical Implementation OptionsDepending on your skill level, here is how to use the framework above:Option A: You want code (HTML/CSS)Submit the Master Prompt to ChatGPT (GPT-4o) or Claude 3.5 Sonnet.Add: "Provide the code in a single HTML file using Tailwind CSS via CDN so I can run it immediately."Option B: You want a visual website builderSubmit the Master Prompt to Framer AI or Wix Studio AI.These tools will generate the actual published site. You will just need to click the button and paste your specific WhatsApp link into the "Link" field.
